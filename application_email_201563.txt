Subject: Application for Business Systems Analyst 2 (NY HELPS) - 10073 - Vacancy ID: 201563

Dear ITS Human Resources Team,

I am writing to apply for the Business Systems Analyst 2 (NY HELPS) position (Vacancy ID: 201563) at the New York State Office of Information Technology Services, as advertised on StateJobsNY.

Please find attached my cover letter and resume for your consideration. I have included the vacancy ID (201563) in the subject line as requested.

I am confident that my Master of Science in Computer Science from SUNY Albany, combined with my extensive experience in business analysis, requirements elicitation, and solution identification, makes me a strong candidate for this role. My experience conducting 30+ customer discovery interviews using structured business analysis techniques (interviews, observation, brainstorming), using techniques such as Root Cause Analysis, Business Process Model, and Fit-Gap Analysis to identify solutions, and creating comprehensive written documentation (BRD, Use Cases, Impact and Feasibility Analysis) that describes what systems must do to satisfy business requirements directly demonstrates that I meet the minimum qualifications for this position.

My experience includes validating requirements throughout the SDLC, verifying requirements through test planning and scenario development, testing scenarios, reviewing test results, identifying constraints and risks, and communicating with stakeholders. I have experience analyzing current/as-is state of business processes, documenting future/to-be state requirements, analyzing the impact of changes, working with stakeholders to resolve design specification challenges, and managing resources for system testing. My leadership experience and ability to guide and mentor staff, combined with my experience developing methodology and standards, positions me well to lead systems analysis and design initiatives for multiple agencies and ITS shared services.

I am currently residing in Albany, NY 12203 and am committed to maintaining New York State residency. I am available to discuss my qualifications further and look forward to the opportunity to contribute to the Office of Information Technology Services in supporting the Finance Administration group and helping agencies achieve their program goals.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
