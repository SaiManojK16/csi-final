Subject: Application for Business Systems Analyst 1 (NY HELPS) - 10066 - Vacancy ID: 201565

Dear ITS Human Resources Team,

I am writing to apply for the Business Systems Analyst 1 (NY HELPS) position (Vacancy ID: 201565) at the New York State Office of Information Technology Services, as advertised on StateJobsNY.

Please find attached my cover letter and resume for your consideration. I have included the vacancy ID (201565) in the subject line as requested.

I am confident that my Master of Science in Computer Science from SUNY Albany, combined with my extensive experience in business analysis, requirements elicitation, and solution identification, makes me a strong candidate for this role. My experience conducting 30+ customer discovery interviews to elicit requirements, analyzing business processes to identify solutions that improve efficiency and effectiveness, and creating comprehensive documentation that describes what systems must do to satisfy business requirements directly aligns with the minimum qualifications for this position.

My experience includes validating requirements throughout the SDLC, developing test plans and scenarios, testing scenarios, reviewing test results, identifying constraints and risks, and communicating with stakeholders. I have experience documenting business systems and processes, performing cost/benefit analysis, participating in meetings with stakeholders to discuss solution options, and assisting with design activities such as creating specifications and workflow diagrams. My strong analytical skills, combined with my technical background and communication abilities, position me well to provide analysis and design support for multiple agencies' and shared service teams.

I am currently residing in Albany, NY 12203 and am committed to maintaining New York State residency. I am available to discuss my qualifications further and look forward to the opportunity to contribute to the Office of Information Technology Services in supporting ITS initiatives and helping agencies achieve their program goals.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
