ACCEPTLY - PRESENTATION SCRIPT
Team B (SVSMC) - CS5610 Web Development

================================================================================
1. INTRODUCTION (1 minute)
================================================================================

Good [morning/afternoon], I'm [Your Name] from Team B (SVSMC). Today I'll be 
presenting Acceptly, an interactive web-based learning platform for finite 
automata theory.

Learning finite automata can be challenging for students. Traditional methods 
often lack hands-on practice and immediate feedback. Our platform addresses 
this by combining visual building, automated testing, and AI-powered tutoring.

Acceptly enables students to visually construct finite automata, test them in 
real-time, and receive intelligent guidance from an AI tutor - all in one 
integrated platform.

================================================================================
2. PROJECT OVERVIEW (1 minute)
================================================================================

Acceptly is a comprehensive drill and practice system that provides:
- An interactive canvas for building finite automata
- Real-time validation against test cases
- AI-powered hints and error analysis
- Progress tracking and analytics
- 50+ problems covering DFA, NFA, and Regular Expressions

Our tech stack includes:
- Frontend: React 18 with Canvas API for visualization
- Backend: Node.js with Express and MongoDB
- AI: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for intelligent tutoring
- Deployment: Vercel for frontend, Render for backend

================================================================================
3. LIVE DEMO - CORE FEATURES (5-6 minutes)
================================================================================

3.1 LANDING PAGE & AUTHENTICATION

Let me start by showing you the landing page. [Navigate to URL]

You can see our interactive FA playground here - this demonstrates FA concepts 
to visitors. [Interact with playground]

Now let's sign in. [Use test account: instructor@test.com / Test123456!]

Notice the clean, modern UI designed for an optimal learning experience.

Key Points:
- Responsive design
- Interactive playground demonstrates FA concepts
- Secure authentication with JWT

3.2 DASHBOARD & PROBLEM SELECTION

After logging in, we see the dashboard with:
- Overall statistics showing completion rates
- Performance graphs tracking progress over time
- Problem history with filtering and sorting capabilities

[Click on Problems page]

Here we have 50+ problems organized by:
- Type: DFA, NFA, Regular Expression, or MCQ Quizzes
- Difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Status: Solved, Attempted, or Unsolved

[Filter by type/difficulty, select a problem]

Key Points:
- Comprehensive problem library
- Easy navigation and filtering
- Progress tracking

3.3 VISUAL FA BUILDER

Now let's build a finite automaton. I'll work on a problem that accepts strings 
ending with '01'.

[Click on a problem]

First, let me show you the problem description in the left panel. It clearly 
states what the FA should accept.

[Click "Add State" button]

I'll click 'Add State' and place states on the canvas. Notice how the first 
state automatically becomes the start state, marked with an arrow.

[Add 2-3 states]

Now I'll right-click on a state to mark it as accepting - you can see it gets 
a double circle.

[Right-click → Make Final/Accept]

To create transitions, I click 'Add Transition', then click the source state, 
then the destination state, and enter the symbol.

[Create transitions: q0 --0--> q1, q1 --1--> q2, etc.]

I can also drag states to reposition them for better organization.

[Drag a state]

Key Points:
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- Visual indicators (start state arrow, accepting state double circle)
- Context menu for quick operations
- Real-time canvas updates

3.4 AUTOMATED TESTING

Now let's test our FA. I'll click 'Run Tests'.

[Click "Run Tests" button]

The test panel opens showing all test cases. You can see:
- Green checkmarks for passed tests
- Red X marks for failed tests
- Each test shows the input string, expected result, and actual result

[Click on a test case]

When I click on a test, I can see the execution path - exactly how the FA 
processed the string, showing each state transition.

[Point out execution path]

This gives students immediate, detailed feedback on why their FA passes or 
fails each test case.

Key Points:
- Real-time validation
- Detailed execution path visualization
- Clear pass/fail indicators
- Educational feedback

3.5 AI-POWERED TUTORING (BEFORE SUBMISSION)

One of our key features is the AI-powered tutoring system. Let me show you 
how it works.

[Click "AI Assistant" tab]

Before submitting, students can get contextual hints. I'll click 'Get Hint'.

[Click "Get Hint" button]

Notice how the AI analyzes my current FA structure - I have 2 states but no 
transitions yet. The AI provides a hint that guides me toward the next step 
without giving away the answer.

[Read the hint]

The AI uses a Socratic teaching method - it asks guiding questions rather than 
providing direct solutions. This encourages students to discover answers 
themselves.

Key Points:
- Context-aware hints based on current progress
- Socratic method - no direct answers
- Adapts to building stage
- Encourages discovery learning

3.6 SUBMISSION & AI ANALYSIS

Let me submit this FA to see the results.

[Click "Submit" button]

After submission, the AI automatically provides an analysis of my FA. It 
identifies what I did well and what needs improvement.

[Show AI analysis]

Now I can chat with the AI about specific issues. Let me ask a question.

[Type in chat: "Why did my FA fail the test with input '001'?"]

The AI provides focused guidance on this specific problem, helping me 
understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

Key Points:
- Automatic error analysis after submission
- Interactive chat for specific questions
- Maintains conversation context
- Only answers questions about current problem

3.7 INTERACTIVE TUTORIAL

Let me also show you our interactive tutorial system.

[Click "Tutorial" tab]

[Click "Start Tutorial"]

The tutorial provides step-by-step guidance. Notice how it highlights relevant 
UI elements on the canvas while showing instructions in the panel.

[Follow tutorial steps]

This helps new users learn how to use the platform effectively without being 
intrusive - they can still interact with the interface during the tutorial.

Key Points:
- Step-by-step guidance
- Visual highlighting of UI elements
- Non-intrusive - allows full interaction
- Panel-based display (no blocking popups)

3.8 INSIGHTS & ANALYTICS

Let me show you the Insights page, which provides AI-generated learning 
analytics.

[Navigate to Insights]

The AI analyzes all my progress data and provides:
- Overall performance summary
- Specific strengths and weaknesses
- Focus areas for improvement
- Key insights and patterns

[Scroll through insights]

It also provides personalized recommendations:
- Problems to retake (low scores)
- Problems to try next (unattempted, prioritized by difficulty)

[Click on a weak concept]

When I click on a weak concept, the AI provides detailed improvement guidance 
with a step-by-step learning path.

Key Points:
- Comprehensive progress analysis
- Personalized recommendations
- Concept-based performance breakdown
- Actionable learning paths

3.9 MCQ QUIZ SYSTEM

Finally, let me show you our MCQ quiz system.

[Navigate to Problems, filter by MCQ]

[Select a quiz]

The quiz interface includes:
- Timer functionality
- Question flagging for review
- Progress indicator
- Navigation between questions

[Answer a question, flag another]

After submission, students see detailed explanations for each question, helping 
them understand the concepts better.

Key Points:
- Multiple-choice questions with timer
- Flagging system for review
- Detailed explanations
- Topic-based organization
